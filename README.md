# Experiment-1
##  Write a C programs  to demonstrate the working of following constructs with possible test cases:
a) do…while b) while…do c) if …else d) switch e) for
## a) Aim
To demonstrate the working of the do...while loop, which ensures the loop body is executed at least once, even if the condition is false initially.

## Algorithm
1.	Initialize the loop variable.
2.	Execute the statements inside the loop body.
3.	After executing the loop body, check the condition.
4.	If the condition is true, repeat the loop; otherwise, exit the loop.

## Program

## Output

## Result

## b) Aim
To demonstrate the working of the while...do loop, where the loop will execute the body of the loop as long as the condition is true.

## Algorithm
1.	Initialize the loop variable.
2.	Check the condition before executing the loop body.
3.	If the condition is true, execute the statements inside the loop.
4.	Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the condition becomes false.

## Program

## Output

## Result

## c) Aim
To demonstrate the working of the if...else conditional statement, which allows for decision-making based on a condition.

## Algorithm
1.	Evaluate the condition.
2.	If the condition is true, execute the block of code inside the if statement.
3.	If the condition is false, execute the block of code inside the else statement.

## Program

## Output

## Result

## d) Aim
To demonstrate the working of the switch statement, which is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

## Algorithm
1.	Evaluate the expression in the switch statement.
2.	Compare the expression's value with each case value.
3.	If a match is found, execute the associated block of code.
4.	If no match is found, execute the default case (if defined).

## Program

## Output

## Result

# e) Aim
To demonstrate the working of the for loop, which is used to iterate a fixed number of times.

## Algorithm
1.	Initialize the loop variable.
2.	Set the loop condition.
3.	Execute the loop body.
4.	After each iteration, increment/decrement the loop variable and repeat until the condition becomes false.

## Program

## Output
